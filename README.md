### As a Digital Nomad

I began my journey as a digital nomad and work remotely as a software engineer trying to contribute effectively to various projects while maintaining the flexibility to explore new horizons. Along the way, I met fellow digital nomads, locals, and individuals from diverse backgrounds.

**- Here we go!**

We are now remote team of like-minded individuals, digital nomads and partner companies who could work together, share their knowledge, and embark on incredible journeys while solving technical challenges for clients worldwide.

### Here is our first project!

I took a deliberate hiatus from my professional commitments to dedicate time to learning cutting-edge technologies and pursuing passion-driven side projects that I had long envisioned. This break provided me with the invaluable opportunity to expand my skill set, deepen my understanding of emerging trends, and develop a range of innovative projects.
